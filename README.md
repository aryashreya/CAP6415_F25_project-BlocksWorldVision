# CAP6415_F25_project-BlocksWorldVision

## Project Title
**A Simple Vision System for the Blocks World**

---

## Abstract
This project implements a simplified version of the *Blocks World* vision system, as described in **Chapter 2** of the CAP6415 textbook.

The goal is to build a basic computer vision pipeline that can analyze a scene containing simple geometric blocks and describe their spatial relationships (e.g., *“Red cube on Blue cube”*).

The system will include the following stages:
1. Image preprocessing and segmentation  
2. Object (block) detection and labeling  
3. Determination of spatial relationships  
4. Generation of a symbolic or textual scene description  

Implementation will be done in **Python**, using **OpenCV** for image processing and **NumPy** for numerical computation.
