# A Simple Vision System for the Blocks World

---

## Abstract
This project implements a simplified version of the *Blocks World* vision system, as described in **Chapter 2** of the textbook.

The goal is to build a basic computer vision pipeline that can analyze a scene containing simple geometric blocks and describe their spatial relationships (e.g., *“Red cube on Blue cube”*).

The system will include the following stages:
1. Image preprocessing and segmentation  
2. Object (block) detection and labeling  
3. Determination of spatial relationships  
4. Generation of a symbolic or textual scene description  

Implementation will be done in **Python**, using **OpenCV** for image processing and **NumPy** for numerical computation.

## Framework and Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `opencv-python` – for image processing and contour detection  
  - `numpy` – for array operations  
  - `matplotlib` – for visualization
