Week 4:

Training Phase Summary:
Processed images 1–6 and extracted region features.

Circles detected in: image1, image2, image4, image6 (both regions)
Blocks detected in: image3, image5

Feature ranges observed:
Area: 301 to 117052
Aspect Ratio: 0.32 to 8.00
Compactness: 26.88 to 158.44

Total training regions: 7

Testing Phase Summary:
All test images (7–10) were successfully analyzed.

Image 7: Predicted Symbol = Circle, Area = 23445, Compactness = 71.42
Image 8: Predicted Symbol = Circle, Area = 69934, Compactness = 172.77
Image 9: Predicted Symbol = Circle, Area = 8904, Compactness = 78.49
Image 10: Predicted Symbol = Circle, Area = 43456, Compactness = 66.97

All test objects were classified as Circle due to compactness dominating the similarity scoring.
