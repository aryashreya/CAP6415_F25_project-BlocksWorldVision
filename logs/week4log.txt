Week 4:

- Implemented BlocksWorld3DReconstructor class to reconstruct 3D coordinates from 2D images.
- Built constraint system including:

-- Ground constraints (Z = 0)
-- Contact edge constraints (Z = 0)
-- Vertical & horizontal edge smoothness constraints
-- Planarity (smoothness) constraints

- Solved sparse linear system using LSQR to recover Z coordinates.
- Recovered full 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) using parallel projection equations.
- Visualized 3D reconstructions (surface plots + color-coded depth maps).
- Processed images 1–9 sequentially with preprocessing + 3D reconstruction pipeline.
- Verified edge detection and 3D reconstruction for accuracy and completeness.
