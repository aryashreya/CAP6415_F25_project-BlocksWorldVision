## Training Phase Summary:
Processed images 1–6 and extracted region features:

- Circles detected: image1, image2, image4, image6 (both regions)
- Blocks detected: image3, image5
- Feature ranges observed:
  - Area: 301 → 117,052
  - Aspect Ratio: 0.32 → 8.00
  - Compactness: 26.88 → 158.44

Total training regions: **7**

## Testing Phase Summary:
All test images (7–10) were successfully analyzed.

| Image | Predicted Symbol | Area | Compactness |
|-------|------------------|-------|-------------|
| image7 | Circle | 23,445 | 71.42 |
| image8 | Circle | 69,934 | 172.77 |
| image9 | Circle | 8,904 | 78.49 |
| image10 | Circle | 43,456 | 66.97 |

All test objects were classified as 'Circle' due to compactness dominating the similarity scoring.
