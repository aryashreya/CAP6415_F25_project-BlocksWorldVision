Week 3:

- Implemented ImagePreprocessor class to handle all preprocessing steps.
- Converted images to grayscale, applied Gaussian blur, and used Otsu’s thresholding.
- Detected edges using Sobel gradients (gx, gy) and computed edge strength & orientation.
- Classified edges as vertical or horizontal based on gradient angle.
- Segmented figure vs. ground using HSV thresholds.
- Detected contact edges (figure → ground) and occlusion edges (ground → figure).
- Visualized preprocessing results for verification.
