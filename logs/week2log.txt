Week 2:
- Conducted a detailed review of the Blocks World problem and its computer-vision requirements.  
- Studied object detection techniques using OpenCV (thresholding, contour detection, edge detection).  
- Collected and organized sample block images for experimentation.  
- Implemented initial preprocessing steps: grayscale conversion, noise removal, and binary thresholding.  
- Tested basic shape detection methods to identify square/rectangular blocks.  
- Updated project plan to include relationship extraction (on-top-of, next-to) after detection.  
- Documented experiments and observations for further refinement.
